Canvas drawer.

This is a jquery command line interface that draws to a canvas.

It works well in Firefox and chrome.
It works in safari but the interface looks wierd.

Right now the optional parameters arent truely optional.

Say I used circle red
that doesnt work.

I need to provide every parameter like `circle 'x' 'y' 'radius' 'colour'`

clear canvas command had to be called `wipe` as clear is a special command on the jquery interface.

Not done:
	The bucket function.
	Auto complete (Can only click on the text and not tab complete)

Next version:
	To add the bucket function.
	To make work better in safari.
	Split code into multiple files.
	Make auto complete tab completable.
	Make parameters truly optional.
